# Requirement Traceability Engine

> A microservice of **Synapse**, an AI-assisted agile project platform built by research group **J26-SE-309**.

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-initial%20setup-orange)

## Overview

This service traces requirements across the project lifecycle, linking them to related artifacts so teams can see how each requirement is covered and what a change affects.

Scope, methodology, datasets and models will be documented here as the research progresses.

```

## Getting Started

Requires Python 3.12, Docker Desktop and Git. Run these in PowerShell from the repository root after cloning.

1. Create a virtual environment and install the backend and ML engine with their test tools:

   ```powershell
   py -3.12 -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e "backend[dev]" -e "ml-engine[dev]"
   ```

2. Start this component's database, then run the API with auto-reload:

   ```powershell
   docker compose up -d trace-db
   cd backend
   ..\.venv\Scripts\uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8003
   ```

   Open http://localhost:8003/docs for the interactive API documentation.

3. Run the tests and the linter (from `backend/`):

   ```powershell
   ..\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest
   ..\.venv\Scripts\ruff check .
   ```

To run the service and its database together in Docker instead: `docker compose up --build`.

### VS Code extension

```powershell
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run compile
```

Then open the `vscode-extension` folder in VS Code and press F5 to launch a development window with the extension loaded.

### Database

This component has its own PostgreSQL database and account. No other component connects to it.

| Setting | Local value |
|---|---|
| Host and port | `localhost:5443` |
| Database | `trace_db` |
| User / password | `trace_user` / `trace-local` |

### API contract

Until the models are in place, the endpoints return placeholder results marked `model_version: "stub"`, so the
gateway and frontend can already be built against the real request and response shapes. The shared JSON
Schemas live in [`Synapse-Web/contracts/traceability`](https://github.com/J26-SE-309/Synapse-Web/tree/main/contracts/traceability);
keep them in sync with `backend/app/schemas.py`.

### Data and models

Datasets and trained models are never committed. Keep them in `AgilePlatform/Datasets/traceability/`, next to the
repositories (see [`ml-engine/README.md`](ml-engine/README.md)).
